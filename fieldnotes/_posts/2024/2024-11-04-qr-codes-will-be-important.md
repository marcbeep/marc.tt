QR Codes will be important.
They're going to be the basis for this new thing called a Digital Product Passport.
I'll save you some time and explain what that is by example.

Let's say I decided to buy a tshirt from Uniqulo. 
The tshirt usually has a label with size info and care instructions etc.
Well that label will now have a QR Code which I can scan.
It'll take me to a third party webpage where I can get some info on the product such as:
* The timeline of the journey of it's materials.
* Sustainability metrics (water usage, CO2 usage, recyclable content)
* Care instructions.
* End of life care (e.g. where to recycle).
