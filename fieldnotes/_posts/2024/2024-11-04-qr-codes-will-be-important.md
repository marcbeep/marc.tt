QR Codes will be important.
They're going to be the basis for this new thing called a Digital Product Passport.
I'll save you some time and explain what that is by example.

Let's say I decided to buy a tshirt from Uniqulo. 
The tshirt usually has a label with size info and care instructions etc.
Well that label will now have a QR Code which I can scan.
It'll take me to a third party webpage where I can get some info on the product such as:
* The timeline of the journey of it's materials.
* Sustainability metrics (water usage, CO2 usage, recyclable content)
* Care instructions.
* End of life care (e.g. where to recycle).

How do we make this trustworthy?
How do we make sure the data is immutable?
Why would companies adopt this (cough - the EU)?

That's what my next startup is. 
World Tag is a digital product passport provider.
