# It's February, Wake Up

> This blog post has a corresponding [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXbKuyyIOpk&lc=&ab_channel=Marc%27sFieldnotes).

Happy Monday!

A lot happened in January—Trump was inaugurated, there were wildfires, major world conflicts saw calls for ceasefires, and China introduced its first real AI competitor…

But now it’s February.

Which means it’s time for me to finally get back to cracking on that new startup idea (and hopefully put out more Fieldnotes videos).

I love making these—I sort of zen out when I get to be creative. So I’m trying to lean into that more, especially when life gets busy.

Anyway, I hope you’ve been keeping up with your own goals.

Let’s smash it.
