When the coronavirus hit, I was left at home with nothing to do.
I knew that I wanted to work with Daniel Batiste on a project, so we began brainstorming different ideas.
Eventually, that summer we put together a small team.
We had to navigate social distancing regulations at the time which was tiresome but we ended up creating this which I am quite proud of.

Wrecked was an official selection for the 2021 TT Film Festival.

## Behind the Story

Fun fact: We took 3 separate days to film the scene with Matthew (the car dealer) and Daniel (the protagonist). 
The actual scene was less than 30 seconds long in the final cut.
