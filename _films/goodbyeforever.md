At the time of writing this film, I had a big milestone happening in my life: I was moving from Trinidad to go study in the UK.
I remember being a bit nervous about it, then channelling that into an over the top comedy.
I knew I always wanted to do a mockumentary like The Office.
That style of filming and improv comedy felt so natural and attractive to me.
I was incredibly fortunate to work with the most amazing cast on this.

## Behind the Story

Fun fact: the party at the end of the film was an actual party we threw when we wrapped filming.
