description: Get out of your own head.

I have no idea who you are. You might be someone with the next big business idea that will change the world, a lonesome author, a misunderstood singer or perhaps you’re a guy that likes to make dumb films in his free time (ahem). Whatever it is, I've got some news for you buddy: you're not a genius.

There we go, like it or hate it, it’s the truth. In a world filled with information flying at us by the gigabyte, you are not the next Mozart. None of us are inherently “special” when it comes to what we create. We’d like to think we are, and this makes sense since we are all the centre of our own universes. With that being said, you’re also not not a genius. What does this mean? It means that you’re neither as terrible nor as good as you think you are. In fact, you’re somewhere in the middle.

The world doesn't care about your art.

Not everyone at least. There’s a billion people in the world. Maybe 5 of them (including your mom) are willing to give your demo a listen or read that draft of the novel you're writing. And that’s alright. Start small with people that support you. These are your true fans. Over time, you’ll gain many more true fans, but we all have to start somewhere. Your “garden” will grow organically and exponentially if you tend to the seedlings (your few true fans) carefully.
