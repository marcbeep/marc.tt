description: This essay is about owning less and doing more.

We accumulate so much stuff throughout our lives.
But we should love everything we own.

This inherently means that over time we have accumulated things we don't love.
The solution? Aggressively evaluate the joy your belongings bring to you. If they don't spark joy, then we should thank these objects for their use and either:

Donate
Recycle
Trash
I believe this should be done on a regular basis.

Thanks to modern consumerism, we have grown to believe that things are constrained to one particular purpose and are limited to a certain time frame (think: a new iPhone is released every year, making the old ones seem obsolete and inferior).
But there is great satisfaction in fixing and reusing things we already own and love. We also tend to gain a deeper connection with our stuff as we spend more time with them.

Don't buy a new one, fix the old one.
