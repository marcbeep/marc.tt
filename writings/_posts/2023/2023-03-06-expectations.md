description: Gracefully accept life.
---

Life does this funny thing where it never works out the way I've imagined.
It's become the rule now that if I hold some sort of expectation, the opposite usually happens.

I've since accepted the fact that it is pretty much useless to have a detailed life plan past
maybe lunch time tomorrow.

The only thing that is constant in life is change.
Health changes. Plans change. People change.
We should change with them.

The more resistant we are to change, and the more expectations we possess,
the more difficult it is to adapt when things don't pan out.

If we can somehow accept things as they are and remove our attachment to potential or alternate outcomes,
the present moment becomes easier.

If we can appreciate things as they are instead of what they can be,
there's some joy in the gentleness of it all.
