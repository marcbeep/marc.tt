# Set actionable goals

There are 2 types of ways we can set goals: Lag measures vs Lead measures.

Lag measures are those that are measure past performances.  
For example, a goal using a lag measure might be "I want to gain 10kg of muscle by December 31st 2023."
You won't know if you've achieved your goal until December 31st 2023.
They're great if you have some big arbitrary target in your mind and if you're motivated by that.
But lag measures are not necessarily within your control.
They're also difficult to change.

Lead measures are those which you have actionable control over.
The alternative to the above example using a lead measure might be "I will work out for 1 hour
everyday and consume 2700 calories per day."
It gives you a set of actions that you can follow and easily change if needed.
You're not guaranteed to gain 10kg of muscle mass by working out for an hour and consuming 7500 calories each day, but it puts the odds in your favour and gives you a sort of psychological comfort.

This is the approach I take to my own goal setting.
