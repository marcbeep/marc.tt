# Excitement & Fear

Like most people in the world, my eyes have been glued to the news since Trump announced his tariffs on “Liberation Day.” I watched the event live and haven’t been able to turn my TV off since.

If you’re not aware, Trump’s tariff plan applies to most countries around the world (including places like Norfolk Island, where only penguins live).

A tariff—put simply—is not a new concept. You might have paid “customs duty” on a package delivered from abroad. It’s essentially the same thing.

For example, let’s say you were a Caribbean island like Trinidad. You might apply a 25% tariff on rum from outside CARICOM to protect the local rum industry (which is why White Oak is so cheap).

Funnily enough, Trinidad also has a 30% tariff on DVD players. I think someone added that and just forgot to remove it—bureaucracy at its finest.

But importantly, tariffs are paid by consumers **within** a country. They make buying foreign goods more expensive and incentivize the purchase of locally made products. Tariffs are usually targeted at specific goods.

So what happens when the world’s largest economy applies blanket tariffs on every country at a base rate of 10%?

Markets panic—that’s what happens.

No one really knows the outcome of this economic policy, and when there’s uncertainty, that’s never good for business. Large institutional investors need certainty, so they pull money out of equities and flock to safer assets like government bonds (or “gilts,” as they’re called in the UK).

Long story short: millions and millions of people have opened their investment accounts and discovered that the value of their portfolios has dropped over the past three days—and there’s no end in sight.

This—combined with media fear-mongering—will inevitably leave many feeling very worried (myself included). This is the first world economic event that has directly impacted me (I was 7 during the 2008 financial crisis).

If you know me personally, you know I’ve always been a big advocate for investing. Three years ago, when I first moved to the UK, I opened an account and haven’t looked back since. But you should understand my personal investing philosophy:

| Principle             | Belief                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I do not gamble       | Money is important. I don’t invest in individual stocks or crypto.     |
| I keep it simple      | I invest in ONE global index fund—nothing more, nothing less.          |
| I keep it diversified | That one fund (FTSE All-World UCITS ETF) includes 3,600 global stocks. |
| I think long-term     | I believe in global progress over 50+ years.                           |
| I am consistent       | I invest the same amount monthly via direct debit, no matter what.     |

People often raise the same objections to investing:

| Objection                                 | Response                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “I don’t know enough about it.”           | It’s easier than ever to open a brokerage account.             |
| “I don’t have enough money to invest.”    | Many brokers allow fractional shares—even as low as £1 or $1.  |
| “The market is bad right now, I’ll wait.” | No one—not even Warren Buffett—knows where the market will go. |

I’m not qualified to give financial advice—nor do I want to—but I do encourage my friends to start thinking about their savings.

You should know: **the value of your investments _can_ go DOWN.**  
My portfolio is currently in the red.  
I won’t share any more details with the internet.

But it has been many times.
And its also been green to the moon.
And it will cyclically be green and red forever.

How does it feel?  
Scary.  
I’m human too.

So I’ve deleted the portfolio app.  
I’ll avoid watching the news.  
I’ll stay level-headed and avoid impulsive decisions.

As Charlie Munger puts it:  
**“The most important thing about compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.”**

So I’ll stay the course and remain disciplined.

Because over the **long** term, this will go back to green.  
I just can’t tell if it’ll take 3 months—or 30 years.  
Both scenarios are possible.

And finally, before I sign off, I’ll leave you with this:

> When you’re winning, you’re not as good as you think you are.  
> When you’re losing, you’re not as bad as you think you are.
