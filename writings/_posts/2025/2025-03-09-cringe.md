# Try not to Cringe

> The art of trying.

A decade ago, the biggest fear around starting something new was “an aversion to failure.”
Today, it’s been replaced by something arguably worse: “an avoidance of being seen as cringe.”

Putting yourself out there is hard - in just about anything.
In fact, doing anything that most people have not done will raise eyebrows, for better or worse.
Somewhere along the line, trying became uncool.

Luckily for me, I’ve never been naturally good at anything in my life.
My friends that have known me throughout secondary school will happily back this up.
But this meant I was always trying to do things that I knew I’d probably never reach a level of success with.
Compare this to most others that never attempt anything that they are not immediately good at.

I’ve always been frustrated with my lack of natural talent, but it’s now become an integral part of my personality that I’ve come to appreciate about myself.

Back to being cringe.

- It’s cringe to start a TikTok page where you crochet.
- It’s cringe to post YouTube covers singing.
- It’s cringe to start a blog where you write about Renaissance art.

Basically, it’s cringe to do anything.
And things are only cringe… until they become successful.

So you might as well be cringe.
