Humans have evolved over many years to be really good at sensing danger.
Back in the cave days we survived because we knew how to avoid being prey.
Hiding. Attacking. Avoiding it all together.

We got so good at it, that those instincts remain with us today.
Except instead of a tiger waiting to eat us, it's probably a looming deadline.
But in reality, there are no immediate threats.
There's no life or death danger pressing us right now.

There is no tiger.
