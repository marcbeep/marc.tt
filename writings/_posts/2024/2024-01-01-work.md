Some time ago I spoke to a man in his mid-fifties.
He had amassed a fair portfolio of real estate and capital despite his humble career throughout his life.
As is my curious nature, I asked how he did it and if he had any tips for me as I was just about to start my career.
He replied with one sentence: “Get up everyday and go to work, everything else will take care of itself.”

I won’t write some pretentious and overly-deep reflection on that phrase.
It just happened to stick with me.
As is human nature, we tend to overcomplicate everything.
We create intricate plans in our heads on just about every aspects of our life.

But life itself isn’t that difficult if we strip away all the unnecessary complexities.
Focus on the process and results will follow.

I’ll leave you with that for the new year.
Good luck!
