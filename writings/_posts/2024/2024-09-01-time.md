There are so many things to do, but it seems like there's never enough time to do them all.
Go to the gym, cook, study, go to work, read a bit, speak to friends - blah blah blah.
Sometimes it seems like there's a never ending checklist of things to do.
As I spoke about in my post [Speedrunning in your 20s](/speedrunning), we want our lives to improve but we want it to improve immediately.

Little progress is misconstrued as no progress.
This leads to a cycle of always "re-evaluating" the plan, which leads to yo-yo gains.
Maybe the plan isn't wrong, maybe we didn't stick to it for long enough.

PS. I realise I'm verging into "self help guru" territory, which is not what I intend.
What I write about is a reflection of whatever I'm thinking about at the minute.
As for Marc's Fieldnotes, if you like the films and articles I make, the best way to support would be to share it (even if it's just to one other friend who might like it).
