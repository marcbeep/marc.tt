# WorldTag

> A digital product passport solution for clothing brands.

WorldTag is a platform that helps clothing brands create digital product passports for their garments. These passports contain important information about the product's journey, from manufacturing to end-of-life, promoting transparency and sustainability in the fashion industry.

## The Problem

The fashion industry lacks transparency. Consumers want to know more about their clothes:
- Where were they made?
- What materials were used?
- How sustainable is the production process?
- What's the environmental impact?

## The Solution

WorldTag provides a simple way for brands to:
- Create digital passports for their products
- Track the product journey
- Share sustainability credentials
- Engage with customers through product stories

## Technical Stack

- Next.js for the frontend
- Node.js backend with Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- AWS for cloud infrastructure
- NFC technology for physical-digital linking
