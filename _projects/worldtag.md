The fashion industry lacks transparency. Consumers want to know more about their clothes:

WorldTag provides a simple way for brands to:
- Create digital passports for their products
- Track the product journey
- Share sustainability credentials
- Engage with customers through product stories

## Technical Stack

- Next.js for the frontend
- Node.js backend with Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- AWS for cloud infrastructure
- NFC technology for physical-digital linking
