## The story behind Spenny

I have always been a massive fan of the app [You Need A Budget](https://ynab.com).
Having been paranoid about not being in control of my finances, the concept of assigning every dollar to a job gave me comfort.
However, YNAB cost me some money per month (around Â£15). 
I felt like I could reduplicate it myself.

Given that I needed to work on something substantial for my Undergraduate Final Year Project, I thought: Why not give it a go?
I ended up scoring really well on my final dissertation and Spenny remains something I spent a lot of time on and I'm proud of.
