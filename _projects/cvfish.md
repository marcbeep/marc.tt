## The story behind CVFish

Having worked at the Career Studio at the University of Liverpool part time for 2 whole years, I felt uniquely positioned to lend a helping hand to my fellow student colleagues.
I really started CVFish as the first project to document on Marc's Fieldnotes (a YouTube channel).
The idea was to take a startup from 0 to 1 and film the entire thing.
I soon found out, it is a monumental task to code alone - let alone film and make a compelling story.

CVFish received some small initial traction however it struggled to retain recurring users.
Amidst a misconfigured server, it ended up racking up some unexpected costs (silly me) and thus I made the decision to cut my losses and take it down.
It is not currently deployed.
