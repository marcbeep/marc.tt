This was my final project for my Master's in Advanced Computer Science.

Monty allows you to create a portfolio of assets and analyse it by using a historical backtest or monte carlo simulation.

Features include:

1. Dashboard showing key metrics, historic chart and portfolio holdings
2. Portfolio builder that has a fuzzy find search via YahooFinance API, and allows you to allocate percentages to assets
3. Backtester that allows:
  - Stress Test using historic dates
  - Monte Carlo simulation with projection bands chart and return distribution curve
4. Portfolio comparison tool
