My friends Daniel, Alex and I started doing LeetCode problems to get better at them and started to document our progress in a GitHub repository.

I turned some of our solutions into flashcards with a NextJS site and made it look at bit nicer with some Framer Motion Animations.

The idea here is that you can filter through popular curated lists, difficulty or by topic if you have an interview coming soon and are short on time and wanted to refresh your memory.
