# About

I'm going to have to write a bio about myself... eventually.
But for lack of better words right now, I'll come back to this later.
Hopefully I don't forget to do this and leave this section perpetually blank.

```json
{
  "manifesto": [
    "Embrace simplicity and minimalism.",
    "Prioritise content and user experience over flashy design.",
    "Keep code lean and hand-crafted.",
    "Value privacy and user empowerment.",
    "Champion accessibility and inclusivity.",
    "Celebrate small projects and authentic expression.",
    "Avoid bloat and unnecessary complexity."
  ]
}
```
