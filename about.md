# About

I'm going to have to write a bio about myself... eventually.
But for lack of better words right now, I'll come back to this later.
Hopefully I don't forget to do this and leave this section perpetually blank.

```json
{
  "about": {
    "name": "Marc Big Shotta Beepath",
    "born": "TT ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¹",
    "bio": "Knows recursion, also knows recursion.",
    "languages": ["Scratch", "English"],
    "facts": {
      "has_side_projects": true,
      "finishes_side_projects": false
    },
    "contact": {
      "email": "marc@reeflinklabs.com",
      "github": "github.com/marcbeep",
      "linkedin": "linkedin.com/in/marcbeep"
    }
  }
}
```
