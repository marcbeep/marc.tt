I’m a final-year Computer Science student at the University of Liverpool. Recently, I completed a commercial internship at Octopus Energy. My most used tools include Typescript (React), NodeJS and MongoDB. I hope to pursue a career that will allow me to marry my leadership abilities with my technical ability to drive real world solutions to difficult problems.
