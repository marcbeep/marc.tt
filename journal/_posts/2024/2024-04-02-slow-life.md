# A Slow Life

> "You often feel tired, not because you've done too much, but because you've done too little of what sparks a light in you" - Alexander Den Heijer

My friend Jun & I stayed in a surf camp for a couple days in Tenerife.
It was a spanish styled hostel in the mountain and the residents were exactly as you'd expect.
There was a finance bro, a valley girl, a middle aged couple in search of adventure... you get the idea.
Each one of them was more cheerful than the last.

Life slowed down for a little while.
An existence where you'd wake up, surf for a bit, have a nap, then surf some more before dinner.
To some, it might seem like a pointless lifestyle where you contribute nothing to society.
To others, it might seem alluring with the prospects of finding meaning within.
For me - the answer might lie somewhere in the middle.

A slow life doesn't mean a life devoid of responsibility. 
Instead, it might translate to a life lived intentionally.
Where we focus on less things, but we do them better.
Where our work and play are balanced and we do things with passion and love.

I've repeatedly needed to remind myself to slow down.
Because if I don't do it myself, life has a funny way of doing it for me.
