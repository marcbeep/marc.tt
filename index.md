# Hi I'm Marc

I'm a postgraduate Computer Science student at the University of Liverpool from Trinidad and Tobago ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¹
I also work part time as a Software Engineer, currently based in the UK.

Check out my [projects](/projects) to see what I've been working on.

When I'm not making computers say Hello World, I make short [films](/films) and [write](/writings).

## Other bits

- I graduated from the University of Liverpool with a BSc in Computer Science in 2023 that cost way too much.
- I was awarded an additional [scholarship](https://napcol.bluechiptt.com/scholarships-2020/) from the Government of Trinidad & Tobago for my results in Computer Science in 2020.
- I earned the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award in 2020.
- Check out some of my [archived short films](https://youtube.com/@Marcbeep).
- I love the ocean. We should protect it (my favourite film is Finding Nemo). I'm a certified PADI Rescue Diver and I've been learning to surf recently.
