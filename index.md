# Hi I'm Marc

I'm a postgrad CS student at the Uni of Liverpool from the Caribbean 🇹🇹 and work as a part-time Software Engineer.

When I'm not making computers say Hello World, I'm trying to build a startup (emphasis on the trying).

## Projects

🪙 **Dime** - Currently working on a personal finance hub.<br/>

🏷️ **[WorldTag](https://worldtag.co.uk)** - A digital product passport solution for clothing brands.<br />

🎣 **CVFish** (No Longer Deployed) - Helps students get their first jobs.<br />

💷 **[Spenny](https://github.com/marcbeep/spenny)** - A zero based budgeting tool.<br/>

🗺️ **[Wildroutes](https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/05/10/enterprising-students-win-design-your-future-awards/)** - Helps you discover nearby, off the beaten path adventures. This won first place in a competition in 2023!

## Other bits

- I graduated from the University of Liverpool with a bachelors in Computer Science in 2023 that cost way too much.
- I was awarded an additional [scholarship](https://napcol.bluechiptt.com/scholarships-2020/) from the Government of Trinidad & Tobago for my results in Computer Science in 2020.
- I earned the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award in 2020.
- I dabbled in filmmaking, check out some of my [archived short films](https://youtube.com/@Marcbeep).
- I love the ocean and we should protect it (my favourite film is Finding Nemo). I'm a certified PADI Rescue Diver and I've been trying to learn to surf.
