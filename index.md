I'm a postgraduate Computer Science student at the University of Liverpool from Trinidad & Toabgo 🇹🇹 <br/>
I work as a part-time Software Engineer at a home automation company.
Beyond that, I'm trying to build a startup (emphasis on the trying). I'm sharing the journey—successes, struggles, and everything in between—over at [Marc's Fieldnotes](https://youtube.com/@MarcsFieldnotes). It's mostly struggles though...

### What I'm working on:

💸 Frank - Connects to your bank account & gives you frank spending insights via Whatsapp.<br/>
✍️ A [newsletter](https://marcbeep.substack.com) and [blog](/fieldnotes).

### Past Projects:

🏷️ WorldTag - A digital product passport solution for clothing brands.<br />
🎣 CVFish - Tailors your CV & Cover Letter to job adverts so you can go fishing for your first job.<br />
💷 [Spenny](https://github.com/marcbeep/spenny) - A zero based budgeting tool to help manage your personal finances.<br/>
🗺️ [Wildroutes](https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/05/10/enterprising-students-win-design-your-future-awards/) - Helps you discover nearby, off the beaten path adventures. This won first place in a pitching competition in 2023 btw!

### Other bits:

💻 I graduated from the University of Liverpool with a bachelors in Computer Science in 2023 that cost waaay too much.<br/>
🎓 I was awarded an additional [scholarship](https://napcol.bluechiptt.com/scholarships-2020/) from the Government of Trinidad & Tobago for my results in Computer Science in 2020.<br/>
🏅 I earned the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award in 2020.<br/>
🎥 I dabbled in filmmaking—check out some of my past [short films](https://youtube.com/@Marcbeep).<br/>
🌊 I love the ocean and we should protect it (my favourite film is Finding Nemo). I'm a certified PADI Rescue Diver and I've been trying to learn to surf (unsuccessfully).<br/>

PS. This site was written in Markdown and is intentionally simple due to my affinity to the [Small Web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/).
