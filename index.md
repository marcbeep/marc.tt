I'm a postgrad CS student at the Uni of Liverpool from the Caribbean 🇹🇹 and work as a part-time Software Engineer.<br /><br />

When I'm not making computers say Hello World, I'm trying to build a startup (emphasis on the trying). <br />
I'm share my thoughts over at [The Fieldnotes Films](/films) and [The Fieldnotes Writings](/writings). You can also signup to [The Fieldnotes Newsletter](https://marcbeep.substack.com).
