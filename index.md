# Hey, I'm Marc Beepath 👋

I'm a postgraduate Computer Science student at the University of Liverpool, and I work as a part-time Software Engineer at a home automation company.
Beyond that, I'm delving into the startup world, and I'm sharing the journey—successes, struggles, and everything in between—over at [Marc's Fieldnotes](https://youtube.com/@MarcsFieldnotes).

### What I'm up to:

- 🚀 A fintech product that makes global payments easier. (Heard that one before)
- ✍️ An email newsletter—though you can find all my past musings [here](/fieldnotes).

### Projects from the past:

- 💷 [Spenny](https://github.com/marcbeep/spenny) - A Zero Based Budgeting tool.
- 🗺️ [Wildroutes](https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/05/10/enterprising-students-win-design-your-future-awards/) - An app to discover nearby, off the beaten path adventures. This won first place in a pitching competition in 2023 btw!

### Other facts:

- 🎓 I was awarded an additional [scholarship](https://napcol.bluechiptt.com/scholarships-2020/) from the Government of Trinidad & Tobago for my results in Computer Science in 2020.
- 🏅 I earned the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award in 2020.
- 🎥 I sometimes dabbled in filmmaking—check out some of my past [short films](https://youtube.com/@Marcbeep).
- 🌊 I love the ocean and we should protect it. I'm a certified PADI Rescue Diver.
- 🏸 When I’m not in front of a screen, I enjoy a good game of Squash.
